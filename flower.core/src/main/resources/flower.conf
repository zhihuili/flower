    # the pool and we want to ensure the maximum possible utilization of the
    # available threads.
    # - hash based - the task - queue in which the runnable should go is determined
    # by using an uniformly distributed int to int hash function which uses the
    # hash code of the Runnable as an input. This is preferred in situations where we
    # have enough number of distinct actors to ensure statistically uniform

      # 128 unique actors and schedule their mailboxes using the map based
      # approach. Once this number is reached the pool switches to hash based
      # task distribution mode. If the value is set to 0, the map based
